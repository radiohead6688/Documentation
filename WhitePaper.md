# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 The Status Quo
With the advent of Web 2.0, social trends and consumption behavior have changed drastically. It prompted a new wave of community-sharing driven by business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and peer-to-peer (P2P) needs in the pursuit of new and better experiences.

However, problems have also surfaced with the rapid growth of the sharing economy, limiting its full potential. The key challenges that needs to be urgently addressed that are hindering the growth of the global sharing economy are high intermediary costs, a trust gap, a monopolistic and fragmented landscape and the lack of risk mitigation.

GSENetwork aims to tap on the huge potential of the sharing economy and champion the growth and transformation of the global sharing economy to create an interdependent network of users and providers.
